### Compilation instructions
This aircraft is designed to be compiled in-sim through the MSFS SDK. Open **C-17.xml** as the project source. 
To compile the systems:
1. Fork the Project
2. Open the Project folder in an IDE of your choice
```js
npm i
npm run dev
```
3. Build the Project in-sim from the world map
4. When ready to contribute, open a Pull Request, including as much detail as possible on your changes
  

### Known issues and bug reporting


Our [FAQ](https://discord.gg/ckPqnBvedj) list contains the most commonly reported issues. Should you have an issue not found on this list, then please take a look at the reported issues within the [issue tracker](https://github.com/flybywiresim/aircraft/issues/) and report a new issue if your issue isn't found there. You can also use the issue tracker to request a new feature.

  

## FAQ

### What liveries are available?
We have many liveries included with the base aircraft, representing a wide variety of operators. If you are interested in more, please check out [Flightsim.to](https://flightsim.to/)

  

### When is the next update?

We don't know, since it depends on many factors. We will announce each new stable version via [Discord](https://discord.gg/T99hTme8PS).

  

### I'm a Developer/Subject Matter Expert/Community member interested in helping development! Where should I start?

We are always looking for passionate members to join the team or help further our goals. Please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/pkCpLtgKz754ETbZA), [email us](mailto:inquiries@deltasimulations.ca), or contact our Lead Developer on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/T99hTme8PS) to get started.

  

### Are Delta Simulation aircraft payware?

No, they are completely free aircraft, open-source, and available to download and further develop on GitHub. [If you appreciate your work, and would like to further our development, we have donations available through Paypal.](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=XAQGKR96M7ZH8) 
As a freeware organization, we often have to self-fund necessary software, equipment, and subscriptions to keep our projects going. After many years of development and thousands of dollars invested into these projects, we are looking to make the group more sustainable in the long term. Donors get a special role on the server, as well as sneak peaks of our development. If you donate, please contact @Destroyer121 on Discord with proof of donation to get your Supporter role.
  

### How do we report bugs?

Please report bugs in their respective sections on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/T99hTme8PS)
  

### Is this going to be "study-level"?

As this is an active military aircraft, it is impossible to simulate every feature available in the real world, or on actual training devices. Our goal is to bring a high fidelity C-17 to the consumer flight simulation platform.

### Is feature X from the real aircraft going to be implemented?

Chances are, yes! While we do not guarantee every single detail of the aircraft will eventually be represented, our goal is to produce an extremely accurate simulation based on technical data and real-world testing. This means you can be almost certain every feature of the aircraft will eventually be simulated to the best of the simulator's ability as long as the technical data backs it up.
  

### Why is my version not the same as what I see others using?

We have two mainline versions: stable and development. The stable version is a 'snapshot' of the development which we regard as stable with the current version of the simulator. The developer build is updated more frequently and is a constant work in progress, with more volatility.
